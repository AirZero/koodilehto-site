    <h2>Koodilehto Logo</h2>

    <div class="right figure">
        <a href="/images/projects/logo/koodilehto_logo.png">
            <img alt="Logo" src="/images/projects/logo/koodilehto_logo.png" width="100" />
        </a>
    </div>

    <p>As the co-operative was formed the need for a logo emerged. The initial designs were centered around a play about the letters of the name, some other ideas around a leaf motif. </p>

    <p>The final logo of Koodilehto Co-operative consists of a black framed tree symbol and the logotype underneath it. The typeface used for the logotype is Latin Modern Sans. This design was selected from a variety of ideas. </p>

    <p>The famous Latin Modern family has a beautiful <a href="http://www.tug.dk/FontCatalogue/lmodernsans/">sans serif typeface</a> which is used as the logotype. </p>

    <p>The first tree-themed versions included a more detailed quickly drawn tree stencil against a solid color background. Color and black-and-white versions were examined but this design was a bit too rough. </p>

    <p>The tree motif comes from the fact that the name Koodilehto actually means 'Codegrove'. The tree, of course, symbolizes the grove <em>pars pro toto</em>. </p>

    <p>A second round of design based on the feedback resulted in more streamlined designs. These were greeted with more acceptance although the preferences of our members differed. We threw some final ideas into the mix and then decided it was time to pick one design. </p>

    <p>The final voting was held in our email list and resulted in a clear winner. The framed tree with branches won the vote. The same tree without the frame came second. The color of the logo was fixed as black. </p>

    <p>All the design work used <a href="http://www.inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a>. </p>
