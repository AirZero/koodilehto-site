        <h2>Showcase</h2>
        <h3><a href="http://kryptoradio.koodilehto.fi/">Kryptoradio</a></h3>

        <p>Kryptoradio makes it possible to access the bitcoin network from anywhere, through DVB. It enables new ways to perform monetary transactions with minimal costs. Currently we are running trials on the technology at Finland.</p>

        <h3><a href="http://elovalo.github.io/elovalo/">Elovalo</a></h3>

        <div class="right figure"><img alt="Elovalo led cube in development" src="/images/elovalo2.jpg" /><p class="teaser">Elovalo, a led cube and pedestal</p></div>


        <p>Elovalo is a joint venture between <a href="http://www.hacklabjkl.org">Hacklab Jkl</a>, <a href="http://www.ihmemedia.fi">IhmeMedia</a> and Koodilehto. The cubes (3 pieces) resulting from the project have effective resolution of 512 voxels and are controllable using C code. Our graphics controller is based on AVR ATMega328 and is quite minimal yet effective.</p>

        <p>The project is a good example of collaboration between local organizations. It showcases our expertise in embedded development and 3D graphics. One instance of this latter was <a href="http://www.blender.org">Blender3d</a> based simulator we implemented and then used to visualize our effects before actual hardware was ready.</p>

        <h3><a href="/projects/koodilehto">Koodilehto Site</a></h3>

        <p>Building this site was quite a project of its own. Instead of building everything from scratch, we ended up using <a href="http://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>, <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a>, <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">Bootstrap</a>, <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> and <a href="http://requirejs.org/">RequireJS</a>. In addition some custom technology, <a href="http://bebraw.github.com/caro.js/">such as a carousel</a>, was developed.</p>

        <p>It is an ongoing project and we work continuously to improve the site. It is a good example of our capabilities on web development and design. Besides doing sites we have expertise in technologies such as Django, Ruby on Rails and Node.js.</p>

        <h3><a href="/projects/ahma">Ahma</a></h3>

        <p>Project Ahma was started in June 2010 at Ylitornio, Finland. This project by <a href="http://koodilehto.fi/professionals/#/zouppen">Zouppen</a> illustrates our capabilities in remote monitoring systems and embedded Linux.</p>

        <p>Since then we've used our expertise in other projects, <a href="http://elovalo.github.io/elovalo/">Elovalo</a> of which is the most important.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://github.com/epeli/effectserver">EffectServer</a></h3>

        <div class="figure"><img alt="EffectServer in use at Instanssi demo party" src="/images/instanssi.jpg" /><p class="teaser">UDP packet abstraction for multiple DMX controllers.</p></div>

        <p>EffectServer is a good example our capabilities with DMX controllers. EffectServer makes it possible to control devices through web. The system has been used at a local demo party, <a href="http://www.instanssi.org">Instanssi</a> with great success. The system has made it possible for attendees to improve their demos and make the atmosphere even greater.</p>
