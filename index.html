        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>There are a lot of open technologies available these days. Besides open source there has been increasing interest in concepts such as open hardware and open data. We are experts with a proven track record in these fields.</p>
        <p>Koodilehto co-operative was formed by a group of software professionals with an academic background. Our strength lies within our variety. While some of us focus more on the web, we have proficiency in data mining and mobile technologies. We are particularly adept at utilizing open source technologies and even develop those on our own.</p>
        <p>We provide primarily following services:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Web development and consulting (sites, services). Example technologies: Django, Ruby on Rails, Node.js.</li>
            <li>Embedded Linux development</li>
            <li>Mobile development (Android)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If you think we could be of benefit for you, please do contact us either via <a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}">email</a> or by phone ({{ site.phone }}).</p>

                    <h3><a href="/projects/koodilehto">Koodilehto Site</a></h3>
                    <p>Building this site was quite a project of its own. Instead of building everything from scratch, we ended up using <a href="http://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>, <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a>, <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">Bootstrap</a>, <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> and <a href="http://requirejs.org/">RequireJS</a>. In addition some custom technology, <a href="http://bebraw.github.com/caro.js/">this carousel</a> included, was developed.</p>
                    <p>It is an ongoing project and we work continuously to improve the site. It is a good example of our capabilities on web development and design. Besides doing sites we have expertise in technologies such as Django, Ruby on Rails and Node.js.</p>

                    <p class="teaser">Remote monitoring and control station based on a single-board-computer, and embedded Linux.</p>
                    <p>Project Ahma was started in June 2010 at Ylitornio, Finland. This project by <a href="http://koodilehto.fi/members/#/zouppen">Zouppen</a> illustrates our capabilities in remote monitoring systems and embedded Linux.</p>
                    <p>Since then we've used our expertise in other projects, <a href="http://www.elovalo.org">Elovalo</a> of which is the most important.</p>

                    <p class="teaser">UDP packet abstraction for multiple DMX controllers.</p>
                    <p>EffectServer is a good example our capabilities with DMX controllers. EffectServer makes it possible to control devices through web. The system has been used at a local demo party, <a href="http://www.instanssi.org">Instanssi</a> with great success. The system has made it possible for attendees to improve their demos and make the atmosphere even greater.</p>

                    <p class="teaser">Elovalo, a led cube and pedestal</p>
                    <p>Elovalo is a joint venture between <a href="http://www.hacklabjkl.org">Hacklab Jkl</a>, <a href="http://www.ihmemedia.fi">IhmeMedia</a> and Koodilehto. The cubes (3 pieces) resulting from the project have effective resolution of 512 voxels and are controllable using C code. Our graphics controller is based on AVR ATMega328 and is quite minimal yet effective.</p>
                    <p>The project is a good example of collaboration between local organizations. It showcases our expertise in embedded development and 3D graphics. One instance of this latter was <a href="http://www.blender.org">Blender3d</a> based simulator we implemented and then used to visualize our effects before actual hardware was ready.</p>
