<p>I am a software developer, electronic hobbyist and a human being. I am studying mathematical information technology at the University of Jyväskylä. In addition to computers, my hobbies include bicycling, geocaching and politics.</p>

<h3>About me</h3>
<p>I have born at Kemi, Finland in 1983. I graduated from upper secondary school (Kemin Lyseon Lukio) in 2002. After graduation I studied physics at the University of Oulu from 2002 to 2004. Physics was not the thing I was for and I applied and got in to the University of Jyväskylä in 2004, mathematical information technology as my main subject.</p>

<p>My studies progressed slowly but surely. I had many hobby projects and I worked part-time while studying so it took over 6 years to finish my Master's degree. I graduated in December, 2011. My secondary subjects were mathematics and statistics.</p>

<p>In addition to enjoying deep scientific conversation I like to talk about almost everything.</p>
                    
<h3>Working experience</h3>
<p>I have done things in my free time. Some of them I have got paid, some are done only for fun. Also, I have years of working experience in the University of Jyväskylä.</p>

<h3>My "hobby" works</h3>
<ul>
    <li>The web site of Social democratic students in Finland. (2006-11-11) The web site was based on Plone. I used to implement some other sites for this organization, too.</li>
    <li>Campaign web site of Jenny Lindborg for Finnish parliament. (2006-11-11) The web publishing system was self-made and it used XSLT to separate content from design and layout.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Full and part-time jobs</h3>
<p>I started my career at the University of Jyväskylä as a part-time teacher (Finnish: sivutoiminen tuntiopettaja) at the Faculty of Sport and Health Sciences in Autumn 2006. It was just a temporary post but it cleared my way for becoming a part-time teacher.</p>

<p>I worked as a trainee at the Faculty of Information Technology in Summer 2007 and 2008. I acquainted myself to XML based study program guide processor developed the previous year as a student project. My work included cleaning up the old code and fixing some issues related to it. I found out that Openoffice was no XML editor of dreams and the whole project was refocused and ported to Web. I worked for 6 months total in this project.</p>

<p>In 2007-2009 I have teached programming for computer science freshmen and those studying it as a secondary subject. The courses were taught in Finnish and include Ohjelmointi 1 and Ohjelmointi 2. I also taught in three subject study courses, Tietoturva (Data security), Algoritmit 1 (Algorithms 1) and Algoritmit 2.</p>

<p>In February, 2010 I got a position of research assistant at the University of Jyväskylä, Department of Mathematical Information Technology. My primary task was Web server log data mining using diffusion maps (DM) method. Other tasks included administration of the network and servers in the communications laboratory and building of laboratory problem sets for students. The length of my position was fixed to eleven months and ended at December 31st, 2010.</p>

<p>After being involved in the university since the beginning of my studies I planned to choose another route. With two of my fellow students we are planning to form a IT start-up in 2011. The details are still a bit misty, but more information is coming soon!</p>
                    
<h3>Something extra</h3>
<p>I am part of social democratic movement. I am a member of executive committee of Social democrats in Jyväskylä (kunnallistoimikunta) and member of the board of our local branch (Jyväskylän Työväenyhdistys).</p>

<p>Codegrove is an important part of my present and future plans. Well, I have no way of knowing what it will be.</p>
